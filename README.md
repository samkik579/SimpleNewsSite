Description of creative project: We allowed the user to create a new profile with their name, birthday, hometown, and a summary. We also allowed the user to edit their profile and update it whenever they want.

We used PHP and mySQL Database to create this project.

Project Requirements:

- Users can register for accounts and then log in to the website.
- Accounts should have both a username and a secure password. NEVER store plaintext passwords in a database!
- For more information on password security, refer to the Web Application Security guide.
- Registered users can submit story commentary.
- A link can be associated with each story, and they should be stored in a separate database field from the story
- Registered users can comment on any story.
- Unregistered users can only view stories and comments.
- Registered users can edit and delete their stories and comments.
- All data must be kept in a MySQL database (user information, stories, comments, and links).

I worked on this project with raekaattari, due to our classroom privacy settings we made individual copies of the repository.
